At each month since January 1873, it shows trailing 24 months of returns in histogram and standard time-series plot.

#Using this visualization
Top menu has 'play' and 'pause' buttons which control the animation. The slider below controls the speed of the visualization. On the timeline, event names can be clicked to move the visualization to that point in history.
