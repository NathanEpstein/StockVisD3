Market
==============
#About
D3 visualization of the S&P index (US stock market) since 1873.

At each month since January 1873, it shows trailing 24 months of returns in histogram and standard time-series plot.

Histogram colors indicate the direction of the market (blue for upward trend vs. red for downward trend).

#Using this visualization
Top menu has 'play' and 'pause' buttons which control the animation. The slider below controls the speed of the visualization. On the timeline, event names can be clicked to move the visualization to that point in history.
